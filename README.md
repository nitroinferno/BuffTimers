There are 2 separate icon windows one for buffs and one for debuffs that can be user configured to limit the total buffs, how many buffs per row, size, and font colors. 
Each buff can be repositioned to anywhere on the HUD by just clicking and dragging the window box. Set the display box setting to 'Yes' to see the buff box space, while you have no buffs or debuffs present
